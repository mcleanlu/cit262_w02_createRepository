# Introduction

Hello there! My name is Luke McLean. Welcome to my README.md file. In this file, I'll be giving you a brief overview of who I am and what I'm all about.

## Personal Interests

I have a few hobbies and interests that I'm passionate about. Firstly, I love DJing and drumming. Music has always been a big part of my life, and I enjoy exploring different genres. My favorite music genres include Rap, Hip Hop, Trance, Funk, Soul, and Drum and Bass.

Aside from music, I also enjoy gardening. I find it relaxing and rewarding, especially when I get to harvest fresh produce from my garden boxes. In addition, I am also into Brazillian Jiu Jitsu. It's a great way to stay fit and healthy, and I enjoy the physical and mental challenges that it provides.

Lastly, I have a strong desire to give back to my community. I love volunteering, especially with hospice and medical teams. It's a way for me to make a positive impact and help those in need.

## Educational Goals

I am currently studying to be a doctor, and I'm also pursuing an undergraduate degree in IT with a focus on Cybersecurity. My goal is to use my knowledge and skills to help people and make a positive impact on the world. I believe that the combination of medicine and technology is a powerful one, and I'm excited to see where this path takes me.
